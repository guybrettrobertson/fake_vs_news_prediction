# NIPS publications analysis

The purpose of this project is to use data on published academic papers to investigate trends in machine learning research over recent decades (1987-2017). The data is an archive of 7,241 publications from the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conferences. This data has been obtained from Kaggle.com.

I use visualisation to show the change in the number of publications over time, as well as Latent Dirichlet Allocation to investigate which are the most prevalent machine learning topics, and how these vary from year to year.
