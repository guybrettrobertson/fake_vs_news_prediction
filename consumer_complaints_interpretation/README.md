# consumer_complaints_interpretation

PROJECT IN PROGRESS

Kaggle.com has provided a large dataset of complaints written by consumers, along with labels for the products and issues (a.k.a. categories) related to the complaint. In this project, I will implement natural language processing techniques including n-gram analysis to predict the complaint issue cited by the consumer for each complaint.
