# Fake vs real news prediction

In this project, I take a dataset of news articles from https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset and implement machine learning classification models to detect whether an article is real news or fake news. The key steps of the project are as follows:

Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis;
Feature engineering and dimensionality reduction;
Model development and hyperparameter tuning; and
Model selection.
