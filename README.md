This repository contains my personal data science and machine learning projects. The key projects included are:
- Real vs fake news prediction: I take a dataset of fake and real news articles and develop an end-to-end model to predict whether an article is real or fake.
- Credit card fraud detection: Using a set of financial transactions and associated data, I develop another end-to-end classification model which can determine whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.
