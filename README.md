# Personal projects

This repository contains my personal data science and machine learning projects. The key projects included are:
- Real vs fake news prediction: I take a dataset of fake and real news articles and develop an end-to-end model to predict whether an article is real or fake.
- Credit card fraud detection: Using a set of financial transactions and associated data, I develop another end-to-end classification model which can determine whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.
- Consumer complaints interpretation: Using a large dataset of complaints written by consumers, I implement natural language processing techniques to categorise the complaints by the issue to which they relate.
- Machine learning algorithms from scratch: In this project, I develop machine learning algorithms from scratch using only low-level Python, Numpy, and Pandas functionality. The algorithms developed to date include linear regression and an artificial neural network. The architecture and hyperparameters of the neural network are flexible, allowing for variation of the number of hidden layers, nodes in each hidden layer, learning rate, and activation function. The neural network is trained using stochastic gradient descent.

#### Tools

The code in this repository is written in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks. I use a number of well known packages and APIs including Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.
